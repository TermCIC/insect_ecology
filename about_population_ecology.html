        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is Insect Population Ecology?</h2>
            <p>Insect population ecology is the study of how populations of insects interact with their environment, 
               including factors that influence their abundance, distribution, and dynamics over time. This field of 
               study plays a crucial role in understanding ecosystem balance and managing agricultural pests.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Concepts in Insect Population Ecology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Population Dynamics:</strong> Examines the changes in insect population size over time, 
                    influenced by birth, death, immigration, and emigration.</li>
                <li><strong>Carrying Capacity:</strong> The maximum number of individuals an environment can sustainably 
                    support, influenced by resource availability and competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Reproductive Strategies:</strong> Includes r-strategists (high reproduction, low survival) 
                    and K-strategists (low reproduction, high survival).</li>
                <li><strong>Predation and Parasitism:</strong> Studies how predators and parasites impact insect 
                    populations and their roles in food webs.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Temperature, humidity, and habitat structure greatly affect 
                    insect population dynamics.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Applications of Insect Population Ecology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pest Management:</strong> Helps design strategies to control agricultural pests effectively, 
                    such as using biological control agents or integrated pest management (IPM).</li>
                <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Protects endangered insect species by understanding their ecological 
                    requirements and threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Ecosystem Services:</strong> Highlights the roles of insects in pollination, nutrient cycling, 
                    and maintaining ecosystem health.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change Studies:</strong> Investigates how changing environmental conditions affect 
                    insect populations and their distributions.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Study Insect Population Ecology?</h2>
            <p>Insects are vital components of ecosystems and play key roles in pollination, decomposition, and as a 
               food source for other organisms. Understanding their population dynamics helps us mitigate negative 
               impacts (e.g., pests) while enhancing positive contributions to biodiversity and agriculture.</p>
