        <h2>History of Normal Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            The concept of the normal distribution originated in the early 18th century. It was first described by Abraham
            de Moivre in 1733, who used it to approximate the distribution of probabilities for sums of independent
            random variables. Later, Carl Friedrich Gauss expanded on this work, applying the distribution to errors in
            astronomical observations, which is why it is sometimes called the Gaussian distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The normal distribution has since become one of the most fundamental concepts in statistics and is used
            extensively in scientific research, economics, psychology, and many other fields.
        </p>

        <h2>Meaning of Parameters</h2>
        <p>The normal distribution is characterized by two main parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Mean (μ):</b> The mean represents the center of the distribution. It is the average value, indicating
                where most of the data points are concentrated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Standard Deviation (σ):</b> The standard deviation determines the spread of the distribution. A
                smaller σ results in a narrow curve, while a larger σ results in a wider curve. It measures how much the
                data deviates from the mean.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            The formula for the normal distribution is: <br>
            <code>
                f(x) = (1 / (σ * √(2π))) * e^(-(x - μ)² / (2σ²))
            </code>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The curve is symmetric around the mean (μ).</li>
            <li>Approximately 68% of data falls within 1σ of the mean, 95% within 2σ, and 99.7% within 3σ.</li>
            <li>The total area under the curve is equal to 1.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
        <p>The normal distribution is used in various real-world applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Height and Weight:</b> Human height and weight distributions closely follow a normal curve. For
                example, most people are around the average height, with fewer individuals at extreme heights.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>IQ Scores:</b> Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores are typically distributed normally, with an average
                score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Measurement Errors:</b> Errors in scientific measurements often follow a normal distribution due to
                random fluctuations in data collection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Stock Market Returns:</b> While not perfectly normal, the daily returns of many stocks approximate a
                normal distribution under specific conditions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The normal distribution is a powerful tool for understanding variability in data and modeling real-world
            phenomena. Its widespread applicability across disciplines makes it a cornerstone of statistical analysis.
