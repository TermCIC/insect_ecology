        <div class="quiz-question">
            <h3>1. What does a p-value represent?</h3>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The probability that the null hypothesis is true.</li>
                <li>The probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed ones, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</li>
                <li>The probability of a significant difference between two distributions.</li>
                <li>The overlap between two distributions.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question">
            <h3>2. What condition makes two distributions more likely to have a significant difference?</h3>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>Small difference in means and large standard deviations.</li>
                <li>Large difference in means and small standard deviations.</li>
                <li>Both distributions having large sample sizes.</li>
                <li>Both distributions having small sample sizes.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question">
            <h3>3. How does increasing the sample size affect the p-value?</h3>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The p-value increases due to more data overlap.</li>
                <li>The p-value decreases due to increased statistical power.</li>
                <li>The p-value stays constant regardless of sample size.</li>
                <li>The p-value becomes invalid for large samples.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="quiz-question">
            <h3>4. Two distributions have μ₁ = 50, σ₁ = 10, and μ₂ = 70, σ₂ = 10. Why is the p-value likely to be small?</h3>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The sample sizes are not specified.</li>
                <li>The standard deviations are equal.</li>

        <div class="quiz-question">
            <h3>5. If two distributions have the same mean but different standard deviations, how does this affect their overlap?</h3>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The overlap decreases.</li>
                <li>The overlap increases.</li>
                <li>The overlap remains unchanged.</li>

        <div class="quiz-question">
            <h3>6. Why is the difference in means important for determining significance?</h3>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>It directly reduces the overlap between distributions.</li>
                <li>It increases the overlap between distributions.</li>
                <li>It does not affect the p-value.</li>

                <li>The p-value is close to 1.</li>
                <li>The p-value is exactly 0.</li>
                <li>The p-value is undefined.</li>
